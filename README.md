# Ghostly Haunts Prototype

This project is a work-in-progress built using the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/), both to explore Godot for the first time and test out a concept I thought of.

## Concept
The game is a 3D side-scrolling platformer; playing as a ghost, haunting a house and scaring its inhabitants using various ghostly powers. While the prototype is not yet fully playable, it serves as a foundation to test out mechanics and refine the gameplay experience.

## Features

While the prototype is not yet playable, some features I have implemented so far are:

- **Ghost Character**: The prototype includes a ghost character model with basic movement controls. The character can move through the walls of the house and cannot be seen by the inhabitants.

- **Human Character**: There is a basic human character I created in Blender, with a state machine and some animations to match. Currently, he roams the house and gets scared if the ghost interacts.

- **House Environment**: A 3D modeled haunted house environment, with a box the ghost can pick up and move around.

- **Scare Mechanic**: The prototype lays the groundwork for a scare mechanic where players will have the ability to frighten the inhabitants of the house. So far, they can do so by picking up a box, which the inhabitants react to.
